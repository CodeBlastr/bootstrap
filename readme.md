Twitter Bootstrap plugin for CakePHP 3.X
========================================

This plugin includes both
[lessjs](http://lesscss.org/#client-side-usage-browser-options) and
[less.php](https://github.com/oyejorge/less.php#lessphp) compilers and allows
you to easilly deploy applications using twitter bootstrap.

With a component and some helpers it automatically replaces cakePHP's elements
like form inputs and flash messages to be displayed with twitter bootstrap.

It also contains bake templates that will help you starting *twitter-bootstraped*
webapps.

Installation
------------

### Adding the plugin

You can easily install this plugin using composer as follows:

```bash
composer require elboletaire/twbs-cake-plugin
```

After doing it, composer will ask you for a version. Checkout the
[package on packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/elboletaire/twbs-cake-plugin)
to know every available version.

Latest version currently is `3.0.0-beta1`, but you can use `dev-master` to use
the latest `master HEAD` version.

### Enabling the plugin

After adding the plugin remember to load it in your `config/bootstrap.php` file:

```php
Plugin::load('Bootstrap');
```

If, for any reason, the `psr-4` addition to the `composer.json` file does not
work, try setting `autoload` to `true` when loading the plugin:

```php
Plugin::load('Bootstrap', ['autoload' => true]);
```

### Configuration

After adding the plugin you can add the desired utilities:

```php
// AppController.php
public $helpers = [
    'Bootstrap.Less', // Parses .less files
    'Bootstrap.Form'  // Generates twitter bootstrap forms
];

public function initialize() {
    // Replaces flash messages (TODO: Extend FlashComponent)
    $this->loadComponent('Bootstrap.Bootstrap');
}
```

Next, **create a `styles.less`** file on your `webroot/less` folder (also create
that folder!) containing this line:

```less
@import '/bootstrap/less/bootstrap.less';
```

Finally, you can use the template included with this plugin as a theme (for
previewing, as it's not functional):

```php
// AppController
public $theme = 'Bootstrap';

// or...
public $layout = 'Bootstrap.default';
```

You can also specify it as a layout directly from your template files:

```php
<?php
// any .ctp template file
$this->layout = 'Bootstrap.default';
?>
```

Take in mind that if you're loading this plugin in a fresh CakePHP installation
and you try to see the layout change in the home page, you won't see nothing.
The `home.ctp` overwrites the layout to `false`, to ensure it's loaded as it has
been designed.

> To load less files on your templates use the [LessHelper](#lesshelper):
On your template, replace your CSS link (probably `$this->Html->css()`) line
with this one:
```php
echo $this->Less->less('less/styles.less');
```

And that's it :)

Baking views
------------

You can bake your views using the twitter bootstrap templates bundled with this
plugin. To do so, simply specify the `bootstrap` template when baking your files:

```bash
cake bake all articles --template bootstrap
```

Utilities
---------

### Component

The **BootstrapComponent** replaces all flash messages (from session key
`Flash.Flash`) to automatically load the bootstrap flash message template
located at `src/Template/Element/flash.ctp`.

### Helpers

#### LessHelper

Used on your template or view to load the compressed CSS.

By default it will compress files using the php parser with cache enabled.
This will fill your `css` folder with a bunch of files starting with `lessphp_`
used for the cache. I recommend you adding these files to your `.gitignore` file
in order to prevent commiting them:

    lessphp_*

Basically, you give the helper a less file to be loaded (from `/less` directory)
and it returns the html link tag to the compiled CSS:

```php
echo $this->Less->less('less/styles.less');
// will result in something like...
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/lessphp_8e07b9484a24787e27f9d71522ba53443d18bbd2.css" />
```

You can compile multiple files if you pass an array:

```php
echo $this->Less->less(['less/myreset.less', 'less/styles.less']);
// They will be compiled in the same file, so the result will be the same as the previous one
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/lessphp_e0ce907005730c33ca6ae810d15f57a4df76d330.css"/>
```

And you can pass any option to both lessjs and less.php parsers:

```php
echo $this->Less->less('less/styles.less', [
    'js' => [
        // options for lessjs (will be converted to a json object)
    ],
    'parser' => [
        // options for less.php parser
    ],
    // The helper also has its own options
]);
```

If you want to use the less.js parser directly, instead of a fallback, or you
want to use the
[#!watch](http://lesscss.org/usage/#using-less-in-the-browser-watch-mode) method,
you can do it so by setting the js parser to development:

```php
echo $this->Less->less('less/styles.less', ['js' => ['env' => 'development']]);
```

This will output all the links to the less files and the needed js files to
parse the content only using the less.js parser.

##### LessHelper Options

Beside the options for
[lessjs](http://lesscss.org/#client-side-usage-browser-options) and
[less.php](https://github.com/oyejorge/less.php#lessphp) parsers you can set
three options to the helper:

+ `cache`: default's to true. If disabled, the output will be raw CSS wrapped
  with `<style>` tags.
+ `tag`: default's to true. Whether or not return the code with its proper tag
  (with cache enabled will be a link tag, whilst without cache will be a style
  tag).
+ `less`: default's to `/bootstrap/js/less.min`. You can use this var to set a
  custom lessjs file.

```php
// Get the link to the resulting file after compressing
$css_link = $this->Less->less('less/styles.less', [
    'tag'   => false
]);

// Get the compiled CSS (raw)
$compiled_css = $this->Less->less('less/styles.less', [
    'cache' => false,
    'tag'   => false
]);
```

As a default setting of the LessHelper, all the CSS generated by the less.php
parser is compresed. To override this set `compress` to `false` in the less.php
parser options:

```php
echo $this->Less->less('less/styles.less', [
  'parser' => ['compress' => false]
]);
```

#### FormHelper

Automatically adds some CSS classes to your form elements. Some of the input
replacements can be found at `src/Config/forms.php`, but many need to be done
directly from the FormHelper.

All the form elements' classes have been replaced with the twitter bootstrap
form classes.

> \* Buttons always have the `.btn` class added. If you want to remove the class
you can pass an additional `btnClass` param set to `false` to the button's
`$options`.
